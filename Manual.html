<H3>How to use</H3>
<A NAME=Project><H4>
1. Make a project.
</H4></A>
<PRE>
A project needs to be made in order to create a BASIC program. Once a project is 
made, an editor opens to type in a BASIC program. 

- There is no particular restriction on project names.
- It is limited for one BASIC program to be created on a project. 
- You cannot open two or more projects at the same time.

If you want to make a new program, please be sure to use "Project New",
not to use"SAVE AS".

</PRE>  
<A NAME=Basic><H4>
2. Create a BASIC program.
</H4></A>
<PRE>
Enter a program according to the specification of the BASIC for the OZ/ZQ700.

- Basically enter in a form like "the line number" + "command".
- Number lines in ascending order.
- The same line number can not be used. (Error occurred)
- See Help Files.

This SDK allows the use of long variable identifiers to make programming efficiently 
while the BASIC for the OZ/ZQ700 does not allow long variable identifiers with 3 
characters and over. (The long variable identifiers will be converted to those with 2 
characters automatically when compiled. )

See <A HREF="#Long">To Use Long Variable Identifiers</A> below.

</PRE> 
<A NAME=Compile><H4>
3. Compile it.
</H4></A>
<PRE>
Select Compile on Build menu to compile the created BASIC program. If error occurs, 
the error message and line number are shown in an error window at the bottom. If 
comple ends correctly, a message as below will appear in the error window:
Done. 0 error(s)
xxxx(project name).obj was created.(xxxx bytes)

Basically, it only converts the program so that not all errors are checked. It must be 
checked if it works well after actually downloaded to the OZ/ZQ700 Series electronic 
organizer.
  
<B>Notes</B>
- Although REM or (') can be used as a remark command in the program, they are cut 
out when the program is compiled because they are ignored when it is executed.
- If there are two or more labels with the same name in the program, the first one to be 
found will be effective. (Up to 16 characters are recognized.)

Major error messages and their reasons
<B>Illegal line number</B>
 - The line number is not in the range from 10 to 30000.
 - The line numbers become smaller from some point.
   (Number lines in ascending order)
 - There are the same line numbers.

<B>Illegal label</B>
 - Something wrong with a * label (i.e. starting with a number, having a symbol, starting 
   with a reservation word, etc.).

<B>Line buffer overflow</B>
 - One line exceeded 255 byte (after being compiled).

<B>Syntax error</B>
 - Other errors (such as no line number at the top, not enclosed with ", no line number 
   on GOTO, etc.).

<B>Undefined label</B>
 - There is no label to jump to (i.e. GOTO, GOSUB and so on.)

<B>Object file size over</B>
 - A program size exceeded 32,687 byte. (There may be cases some addition can be 
   made to a line on the way even if this message appears.)

<B>What are not or cannot be checked</B>
 - What cannot be found without actually running the program.
     - The maximum number of steps of GOSUB~RETURN or FOR~NEXT.
     - Unsecured tactic variables.
     - Exceeded memory for variables being used.
 - Checking the range of parameter and integrity of each statement.

<A NAME=Wzd><H4>
4. Create a WZD file. (Make WZD)
</H4></A>
<PRE>
Select Make WZD on Build menu to create a WZD file which can be downloaded. If it is 
grayed out, select WZD Setting on Build menu to provide the following necessary 
information for WZD file creation:

 - Title: The title to be shown on the OZ/ZQ700. Max. 19 characters.
 - Description: "Summarized explanations" to be shown in the downloader. It will not be 
   downloaded to the OZ/ZQ700 Series electronic organizer.

No error message will appear here and the file will be created without fail.

</PRE>
<A NAME=Download><H4>
5. Download.
</H4></A>
<PRE>
Now you only have to download the program. Select Download on Build menu to 
designate the current WZD file and start the Downloader. Then connect the 
Downloader to the OZ/ZQ700 Series electronic organizer and press LOAD button on 
it to download. 

Make sure that "Downloader for SHARP Electronic Organizer V2.X is installed in your 
PC.

</PRE>   
<A NAME=Debug><H4>
6. Check how the program works and debug it.
</H4></A>
<PRE>
After download is completed, run the program on the OZ/ZQ700 Series electronic 
organizer unit to check how it works. In order to debug, insert lines to display variables 
just for the purpose because you can neither execute the program step by step nor 
trace it on the unit. 

When you find errors on the program, return to the step 2 above to create and 
download a WZD file again.

- When you download a program (a WZD file) of the same project again, make sure to 
 delete the existing program on the OZ/ZQ700 Series electronic organizer before doing 
 so. If not deleted, an error message saying that there are identical programs will 
 appear and the program will not be downloaded.


</PRE>

<A NAME=Long><B>To Use Long Variable Identifiers</B></A>
<PRE>
 Although the OZ/ZQ700 Series electronic organizer only recognizes variable 
identifiers with two or less characters, you may want to name variables with some 
meanings when you create a program. This SDK has a variable conversion function to 
convert variables so that you can use long variable identifiers while programming. 

The variable conversion function converts the long variable identifiers which have 
been defined in advance into those with two characters starting with a letter Z (a total 
of 36 variable identifiers from Z0 to Z9 and from ZA to ZZ) when the program is 
compiled.
 
Therefore, you can use up to 36 variable identifiers for each kind of variables (such as 
numeric variable, string variable, array numeric variable and array string variable). 

 - Do not use any variable starting with a letter Z when you use the function.
 - Characters which can be used for the long variable identifiers are alpha-numerics.
 - The variables are not case sensitive as on normal variables. (In other words, upper 
   and lower-case letters are treated as the same.)
 - Once defined, even short variable identifiers will be converted. 
   Define a: A variable "a" will be converted.

It is simple to use. Just list variable identifiers after Define at the first line of the 
program without a line number.

<B>&lt;Example of the Use&gt;</B>
To define Flag, Name$ and Area(). (Area() is an array variable.)

Define Flag,Name$,Area()

Describe aligned variables like Glay() and Larc$().

<B>Other</B>
<PRE>
When open a project by designating a BAS file but the project does not exist, the BAS 
file will be read in and a project will be newly created.
