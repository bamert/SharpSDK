<PRE>
<I><B>FORMAT:</B></I> DATA list of values

<I><B>See Also:</B></I> READ, RESTORE

<I><B>PURPOSE:</B></I>
Provides values for use by READ.

<I><B>REMARKS:</B></I>
When assigning initial values to an array, it is convenient to list the values in a DATA 
statement and use a READ statement in a FOR...NEXT loop to load the values into the 
array. When the first READ is executed, the first value in the first DATA statement is returned. 
Succeeding READs use succeeding values in the sequential order in which they appear in 
the program, regardless of how many values are listed in each DATA statement or how 
many DATA statements are used.

A DATA statement may contain any numeric or string values, separated by commas. 
Enclose string values in quotes. Spaces at the beginning or end of a string should be 
included in the quotes.

DATA statements have no effect if encountered in the course of regular execution of the 
program, so they can be inserted wherever appropriate. Many programmers include them 
after the READ that uses them. If desired, the values in a DATA statement can be read a 
second time using the RESTORE statement.

Do not use the multi-statement.


<I><B>EXAMPLE:</B></I>
10 DIM B(10)
20 WAIT
30 FOR I = 1 TO 10
40 READ B(I)
50 PRINT B(I)
60 NEXT I
70 DATA 10,20,30,40,50,60
80 DATA 70,80,90,100
90 DATA "AB", "AB:CD"
100 END

[10] Sets up an array.
[40] Loads the values from the DATA statement so that B(1) will be 10, B(2) will be 20, B(3) will be 30, etc.

<I><B>PURPOSE:</B></I>
Erases specified arrays.

<I><B>REMARKS:</B></I>
Array elements cannot be erased individually; the whole array is cleared and its memory 
area is freed. To re-define an array size, first ERASE it and then re-specify it in a DIM 
statement.

Do not use the ERASE command within a FOR...NEXT loop.
ERASE command can not be used in multi-statement.

 10 DIM AA (10)
  :
  :
200 ERASE AA

<I><B>FORMAT:</B></I>  FOR  numeric variable = expression 1 TO  expression 2
                  [STEP expression 3]

            NEXT  numeric variable

<I><B>PURPOSE:</B></I>
In combination with NEXT, repeats a series of operations a specified number of times.

<I><B>REMARKS:</B></I>
FOR and NEXT are used in pairs to enclose a group of statements that are to be repeated.
If the variable following NEXT is omitted, the variable following FOR is assumed. The first 
time this group of statements is executed the loop variable (the variable named immediately 
following FOR) is assigned its initial value (expression 1).

When execution reaches the NEXT statement, the loop variable is increased by the STEP 
value (expression 3) and then this value is tested against the final value (expression 2). 
EXPRESSION 3 is plus If the value of the loop variable is less than or equal to the final 
value, the enclosed group of statements is executed again, starting with the statement 
following FOR. EXPRESSION 3 is minus If the value of the loop variable is more than or 
equal to the final value, the enclosed group of statements is executed again, starting with 
the statement following FOR. If expression 3 for step size is omitted, the increment becomes 
1. If the value of the loop variable is greater than the final value, execution continues with the
statement that immediately follows NEXT. Because the comparison is made at the end, the 
statements within a FOR...NEXT pair are always executed at least once.

When the increment is zero, FOR...NEXT will continue in an infinite loop.

The loop variable may be used within the group of statements, for example as an index to an 
array, but care should be taken in changing the value of the loop variable.

Write programs so that the program flow does not jump out of a FOR...NEXT loop before 
the counter reaches the final value. To exit a loop before it has been repeated the specified 
number of times, set the loop variable higher than the final value.

The group of statements enclosed by a FOR...NEXT pair can include another pair of 
FOR...NEXT statements that use a different loop variable as long as the enclosed pair is 
completely enclosed; i.e., if a FOR statement is included in the group, the matching NEXT 
must also be included. FOR...NEXT pairs may be "nested" up to six levels deep. Illegally 
jumping out of an inner loop will generate an error, a nesting error.

Do not use the CLEAR, DIM or ERASE command within a FOR...NEXT loop. And do not 
use more than one "FOR" or "NEXT" command in a line.

FOR...NEXT statement may be "nested" up to 6 levels deep.

Do not use the multi-statement after FOR...TO(...STEP).
Release ERROR BRANCH with ON ERROR GOTO 0 before a line including FOR 
because it will cause an error in the line to cause malfunction.

  RETURN

<I><B>See Also:</B></I> GOTO, ON...GOSUB

<I><B>PURPOSE:</B></I>
Diverts program execution to a BASIC subroutine.

<I><B>REMARKS:</B></I>
When you wish to execute the same group of statements several times in the course of a 
program, it is convenient to use the BASIC capability for subroutines using GOSUB and 
RETURN.

The group of statements is included in the program at some location where they are not 
reached in the normal sequence of execution. A common location is following the END 
statement that marks the end of the main program.

At each location in the main body of the program where a subroutine is to be executed, 
include a GOSUB statement with a line number or *label that indicates the starting line 
number of the subroutine. The last line of each subroutine must be a RETURN.
When GOSUB is executed, the device transfers control to the indicated line number or 
*label and processes the statements until a RETURN is reached. Control is then transferred 
back to the statement following the GOSUB.

Subroutines may be "nested" up to 10 levels deep.

Since there is an ON...GOSUB structure for choosing different subroutines at given 
locations in the program, the expression in a GOSUB statement usually consists of just the 
desired line number or *label.

Do not use ELSE statement, if GOSUB statement is used in THEN statement.
Otherwise ERROR number is not correct if error occurred in RETURN statement.

Do not use more than one "GOSUB" or "NEXT" command in a line.

<I><B>EXAMPLE:</B></I> 
 10 WAIT
 20 GOSUB 100
 30 END
100 PRINT "HELLO"
110 RETURN

When run, this program prints HELLO once.

<I><B>See Also:</B></I> AND, OR, NOT, XOR

<I><B>PURPOSE:</B></I>
Conditionally executes a statement at the time the program is run.

<I><B>REMARKS:</B></I>
When the condition of the IF statement is true, the statement following THEN is executed; if 
it is false, the statement following ELSE is executed. When the ELSE statement is omitted 
and the condition is false, the statement following THEN is skipped.

Put LET statement before using "=" statement such as "A=A-1", Otherwise error 
line number is not correct, if error occurred in IF statement.

If THEN or ELSE is followed by a GOTO statement, either THEN or GOTO may be omitted 
(ELSE statement must be included).

<I><B>EXAMPLE 1:</B></I>
IF A &lt; 5 THEN LET C=A*B
IF A is smaller than 5, then assign the product, A*B, to C.

<I><B>EXAMPLE 2:</B></I>
IF B=C+1 GOTO 60 :ELSE 100
or
IF B=C+1 THEN 60 :ELSE 100
If B equals C+1, then go to line 60; otherwise go to line 100.

<I><B>EXAMPLE 3:</B></I>
IF A=B THEN LET A=B+1:ELSE LET A=A-1


The condition (e.g. A &lt; 5) of the IF statement can be any relational expression as listed 
below.
</PRE>

<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR><TH>Relational expression</TH><TH>Description</TH></TR>

</TR>
</TABLE>
<PRE>
Note : OO and XX represent expressions (5*4, A, 8, etc.).

More than one relational expression can be linked with the logical operators "*" or "+". 
For example:
IF (A&gt;5) *(B&gt;1) THEN...
If A is greater than 5 and B is greater than 1, the statement following THEN is executed. 
Logical operator "AND" may be used in place of "*".
IF (A&gt;5)+(B&gt;1) THEN...
If A is greater than 5 or B is greater than 1, the statement following THEN is executed. 
Logical operator "OR" may be used in place of "+".

<B>Using Character Strings in Relational Expressions</B>
The magnitudes of character strings can be compared when used in a relational expression 
of an IF...THEN...ELSE statement. The magnitudes of character codes are compared. For 
example, characters A, B, and C have codes 65, 66, and 67, respectively. So A is smaller 
than B, and B is smaller than C.

<I><B>EXAMPLE:</B></I>
10 INPUT"CONTINUE?";A$
20 IF A$="YES" THEN 10
30 IF A$="NO" THEN 60
40 PRINT "YES OR NO, PLEASE"
50 GOTO 10
60 END

Note:
Whenever a variable name is to be followed by a statement, be sure to insert a space 
between them, for example:
100 IF A=B_THEN 200
           A space is needed.
Pay special attention to this when you use the IF, FOR, ON...GOTO, or ON...GOSUB 
command.

Release ERROR BRANCH with ON ERROR GOTO 0 before a line including IF statement because 
it will cause an error in the line to cause malfunction.

<I><B>See Also:</B></I> PRINT, GPRINT, CIRCLE

<I><B>PURPOSE:</B></I> 
Controls the length of time that displayed information is shown before program execution 
continues.

<I><B>REMARKS:</B></I>
Format 1 specifies the time in which execution of the PRINT command halts. The program 
temporarily halts for the specified time interval, then automatically restarts.

The value of the expression may be set to any value from 0 to 1800. A value of 1 as the 
expression corresponds to an interval of approx.1/10 sec. The power on default for the value 
of the expression is zero.
Keep in mind when you use WAIT that it is impossible to discontinue with ESC, ON or 
application keys during WAIT. Execute WAIT 0 to release WAIT. 
To set an infinite interval, use format 2.
Press the Enter key to restart the program again. ESC key cannot discontinue the program 
during WAIT.
Execute WAIT 0 to release WAIT.
The WAIT command is valid for all the PRINT,CIRCLE or GPRINT commands used in the 
program. 
Do not enter 2nd keys during WAIT.
At the beginning of a program wait value is 0

Note:
The WAIT command is not available on personal computers in general. On PCs, the 
FOR...NEXT statement is used for wait time control as follows:
50:FOR J=1 TO 500:NEXT J

<I><B>EXAMPLE:</B></I>
10:WAIT 10

Causes PRINT to wait about 1 second.

<I><B>REMARKS:</B></I>
The EOF function checks if all data in a sequential file (with the specified file number) has 
been read.

If all data has been read, EOF returns -1 (true) as its function value. If not, EOF returns 0 
(false). For the device name COM, EOF returns 0.
An error occurs if a file with the specified number has not been opened for input.

<I><B>EXAMPLE:</B></I>
IF EOF (1) THEN CLOSE #1

File #1 is closed if all data in that file has been read.

<I><B>PURPOSE:</B></I> 
Format 1 opens the file specified by "E:filename" for use with the specified file number. 
Subsequent input/output to the file is accomplished by referring to the file number.  
Formats 2 allow data to be transferred through the serial I/O interface (COM).

<I><B>REMARKS:</B></I> 
The file number must be from 1 to 5.  

A total of 5 file number control areas for a flash memory and serial I/O interface. However, 
only one file can be opened as #1 for devices COM.  


In format 1 , "mode" specifies the method of access to the file, as follows:  
INPUT	Specifies sequential input from an existing file.  
OUTPUT	Specifies sequential output to a file.  
APPEND	Specifies addition to a sequential file.  

If OUTPUT is specified using an existing filename, that file is erased before the new one is 
created.  

An error occurs when using the APPEND or INPUT mode if the specified file does not exist.
An error occurs if an attempt is made to open a file which has already been opened, or 
allocate a file number which has already been allocated.  

<B><I>Note:</I></B>
File is made related with BASIC Program. If you delete the BASIC program on the unit then 
related file will be deleted.

Although one to seven letters can be used as a file name created on
E:drive, it is recommended to <B>use long names</B> in order to prevent them to
be the same as file names in other programs. 

File name is max 7 characters. And spaces after characters is not recognized as the file 
name. ("E:TESTA " and "E:TESTA" are treated as a same file name.)

COM port is only used for #1

CLOSE immediately after completing file input/output.
Use the POWER key to discontinue a program when a COM port is used.

Do not use "INPUT" and "INKEY$" including "INKEY$(1)" when COM is opened because it may
cause the communication speed to become unstable.

<I><B>EXAMPLE:</B></I>  

For flash disk E

<PRE> 
<I><B>See Also:</B></I> OPEN, INPUT#

<I><B>PURPOSE:</B></I>  
Writes values of specified variables into a specified file.

<I><B>REMARKS:</B></I>
PRINT# is valid only for a file opened for OUTPUT or APPEND with the OPEN command. 
The file number is the number given to the file when opened.

When a character or string element is used, it must not be specified using a comma (,) or 
semicolon (;):
PRINT#2,"ABC"
PRINT#2,A$
If PRINT#2,"ABC";A$ is executed, no data delimiter is written and "ABC" and A$ cannot be 
distinguished.

A numeric value is recorded in such a from that the sign (space when it is positive),
numeric character string, and space appear in that from. The recording format is shown 
below:

(1) When a comma or semicolon does not follow the data, CR(&H0D) and LF(&H0A) are 
provided.

<I><B>EXAMPLE:</B></I>
PRINT #2,-1.2
   -1.2_ CR LF   ( _ is a space character)

PRINT #2,"ABC"
    ABC CR LF

(2) When a comma follows the data, 20 bytes are occupied. A numeric value is right justified 
and a character string is left justified.
<I><B>EXAMPLE:</B></I>

PRINT#2,"ABC","DEF"
   ABC- (20 bytes) DEF CR LF

When the character string exceeds 20 bytes, the excess part is written to the next 20-byte 
area. The maximum size is 254 bytes.

(3) When a semicolon follows the data, it is stored without spaces.
<I><B>EXAMPLE:</B></I>
PRINT #2,-1.2;3
     -1.2  3 CR LF

PRINT#2, "ABC";"DEF"
     ABCDEF CR LF

in this case, character strings "ABC" and "DEF" are not read separately.

<I><B>EXAMPLE:</B></I>
10 OPEN "E:DATA" FOR OUTPUT AS #2
11 N=10
12 M=10
15 DIM C$(N,M)
20 FOR J=0 TO N
30 FOR K=0 TO M
40 PRINT #2,C$(J, K)
50 NEXT K
60 NEXT J
70 CLOSE

Note:
Maximum file size is approx. 15,000 Byte.

		*label

<I><B>See Also:</B></I> ON ERROR GOTO

<I><B>PURPOSE:</B></I>
Resumes program execution at the end of an error handling routine.

<I><B>REMARKS:</B></I>
RESUME resumes program execution after completing an error handling routine to which 
control was passed by the ON ERROR GOTO command. This command validifies the ON 
ERROR GOTO command again. If control is returned to the main program by any other 
command(GOTO, etc.),execution will be aborted if an error subsequently occurs.

The error handling routine lets you take the necessary action to prevent recurrence of the 
same error.

Control is returned depending on the format:
(1) Format 1 returns control to the statement which caused the error. If an error occurs again 
    in the same statement, the error handling routine is executed again.
(2) Format 2 returns control to the statement following the error statement.
(3) Format 3 returns control to the specified line.


<I><B>EXAMPLE:</B></I>
 10 ON ERROR GOTO 100
 20 INPUT A,B
 30 PRINT A/B
   :
   :
100 RESUME 20
   :

If zero is assigned to variable B or an overflow occurs from A/B,control returns to the input 
routine on line 20 and prompts for correct data entry.

Note:
Please be sure to put "END" statement after RESUME command
The use of RESUME NEXT to deal with errors in a line including OPEN is prohibited 
because it will cause an error in the line to cause malfunction of RESUME NEXT.
