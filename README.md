Please note that I claim no rights over this software.
This software was initially provided by Sharp as an SDK for the ZQ750M
organizer device and contained a BASIC compiler.

I am providing this repository in the hopes that somebody who may still be looking for this
may find it here, for Sharp does not provide it on their website any longer.
