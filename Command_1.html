<I><B>FORMAT:</B></I>	Expression AND expression
         Conditional expression AND conditional expression

<I><B>See Also:</B></I> OR, NOT, XOR, IF

<I><B>PURPOSE:</B></I>
 Finds out a logical multiplication between expressions. Also,
it connects conditional expressions.

<I><B>REMARKS:</B></I> 
* Values of logical multiplication is as follows in
digital numbers:
1 AND 1=1    0 AND 1=0
1 AND 0=0    0 AND 0=0

Even when finding logical multiplication in decimal numbers, the
decimal numbers are converted into digital ones to find logical
multiplication of each digit and then the results are turned back to be
in decimal numbers. 

<I><B>EXAMPLE:</B></I>
	41 AND 27 = 9
41 and 27 are converted into digital numbers(101001 and 011011) and AND in each digit is
taken off. Then the result(001001) is converted back to be in decimal number
which is 9.
* Integral parts of the values ranging from -32,768 to 32,767 are
effective.

<I><B>FORMAT:</B></I> CIRCLE (expression 1, expression 2), expression 3 [,[expression 4]
                 ,[ expression 5] ,[ expression 6] [,[ S | R | X] ,[ expression 7]]]


<I><B>PURPOSE:</B></I> 
Draws circles, sector forms and ellipses in the DEGREE mode.  
<I><B>REMARKS:</B></I>
* Draws a circle with a point indicated with (expression1, expression2)
as a center and the length (the number of dots) indicated with
expression3 as a radius.

Expression1: An X-coordinate of the central point. It is 0 at the left
end and 238 at the right end.
Expression2: A Y-coordinate of the central point. It is 0 at the upper
end and 69 at the lower end. 

The values of the expressions 1 and 2 can be designated from the numbers
ranging from -32,768 to 32,767. However, when they exceed the range
given above, a circle is drawn with the designated point outside the
display as the center. 

* The radius of the circle is designated by the expression 3 in the
number of dots. The value of the expression 3 is within a range from 1
to 32,767.

* The expression 4 and the expression 5 indicate the angle to start
drawing and the one to end drawing, respectively, in units of degrees.
The values of the expressions 4 and 5 are designated within a range from
0 to 360 degrees. It is zero at the right side of the central point and
draws in a counterclockwise rotation. If the values are not set, the
angle to start drawing will be zero and the one to end drawing will be
360 (and it will be a circle).

Please designate angles in the DEGREE mode, circles cannot be drawn
correctly in RADIAN and GRAD modes.

* You can draw sector forms by setting negative numbers for the starting
and the ending angles because it draws a line between a circumference
and the central point of the circle (a radius line). When a negative
number is set, it is considered that its absolute value is set to draw a
figure. Also, when an angle is designated in a variable in order to draw
a radius line with zero degree angle, you can either designate -360
degrees or -1* a name of a variable. Even if -0 is entered as a
variable, it is considered as +0.

* The value of the expression 6 indicates a ratio.
A circle is drawn when the ratio is 1, and ellipses are drawn in other
cases. If nothing is designated, it is set as 1.
             Y-axial radius (ry)
Ratio = ------------------
             X-axial radius (rx)     

Set the ratio as 0.5 to draw an ellipse which is long sideways.

* Designate S, R or X to light on, turn off or inverse the dots on the
circumference of the circle, respectively. If nothing is designated, it
is set as S.
S: Draw Circle while activating the corresponding dots on the screen(set).  
R: Draw Circle while deactivating the corresponding dots on the screen (reset ). 
   This option is useful to draw a line in reverse video or to erase an existing line. 
X: Draw Circls, activating the corresponding dots if they are inactive, or deactivating the
    corresponding dots if they are already active (reverse).  

* The expression 7 indicates a pattern within a circle as below. If
nothing is designated, it is set as 0.
    0: White
    1: Stripe (Vertical) 
    2: Stripe (Horizontal)
    3: Stripe (Diagonal line)
    4: Stripe (Diagonal line)
    5: Check
    6: Black

<I><B>EXAMPLE:</B></I>
 CIRCLE(71,23),20,,,0.5,,2
Draws an ellipse which is long sideways.

 CIRCLE(71,23),20,-45,-135
Draws a sector form.

Note: 
* Even in case to draw a part of a circle, all of the circle must
be within the range (from -32,768 to 32,767), otherwise an error will
be caused.
* Figures like circles, diagonal lines and curved lines may not be drawn
with specific lines because they are composed of dots.
* Drawing mat not be precise when a sector form with a small radius is
drawn.

<I><B>FORMAT:</B></I> DEGREE

<I><B>See Also:</B></I> GRAD, RADIAN

<I><B>PURPOSE:</B></I>
Changes the form of angular values to decimal degrees.

<I><B>REMARKS:</B></I>
The device has three forms for representing angular values - decimal degrees, radians 
and gradient. These forms are used in specifying the arguments to the SIN, COS, and TAN 
functions and in returning the results from the ASN, ACS, and ATN functions.

The DEGREE function changes the form of all angular values to decimal degree form until 
GRAD or RADIAN is used. The DMS and DEG functions can be used to convert angles from 
decimal degree form to degree, minute, second form and vice versa.
At the beginning of a program the form of angular values to decimal degrees.

<I><B>EXAMPLE:</B></I>
10 DEGREE
20 X = ASN 1
30 WAIT
40 PRINT X

[20] X now has a value of 90; i.e., 90 degrees, the arc sine of 1.

<I><B>FORMAT:</B></I> 1. DIM variable name (size 1 [, size 2]) [, variable name (size 1 [, size 2])...]
          2. DIM string vriable name (size 1 [, size 2])*size 3
                                     [, string variable name (size 1 [, size 2])*size 3...]

<I><B>See Also:</B></I> ERASE, CLEAR

<I><B>PURPOSE:</B></I>
Reserves space for numeric and string array variables.

<I><B>REMARKS:</B></I>
DIM must be used to reserve space for an array variable. The size of an array is the number 
of elements in that array.

The variable name consists of a letter and up to 2 alphanumeric characters. For string 
variables, "$" is attached to the end of the variable name.

Size 1, size 2 are called the "subscripts", and specify the number of elements in the nth 
dimension of the array. An array with one subscript is called a one-dimensional array, with 
two subscripts, it is called a two-dimensional .


<I><B>EXAMPLE:</B></I>
DIM B(3):
    one-dimensional array B( ) reserves 4 array elements B(0), B(1), B(2) and B(3).
DIM XA$(2,3):
    two-dimensional string array XA$( ) reserves 12 array elements XA$(0,0), XA$(0,1)
    , ..., XA$(2,2), XA$(2,3)

Integers 0-255 can be used as subscripts, but an error may occur if a variable with the 
specified size cannot be reserved because of limits in the memory size and conditions of 
use.

If the subscripts include a decimal point, only the integer part will be recognized (and the 
fractional part will be ignored).

The length of the character strings can be defined by FORMAT2.
Defined by setting the 1-255 numbers in Size 3. 

<I><B>EXAMPLE:</B></I>
DIM A$(3)*20

A$ is string array variable which is 20 character length.

Numerical array and string array variables are recognized as different arrays; thus, 
the arrays Z( ) and Z$( ) can be defined simultaneously.

The DIM statement cannot be used within a FOR...NEXT loop.

More than one array can be declared using one DIM statement.

<I><B>EXAMPLE:</B></I>
DIM V(5), K$(4,3), XB$(5)

If an array has been defined, it cannot be defined again. For example, both DIM X(5) and 
DIM X(3,4) cannot be defined since the variable names are the same.

When a program is executed, allocated array variables are cleared.

<I><B>EXAMPLE:</B></I>
50 ERASE X
60 DIM X(3,4)

Numerical array and string array variables are recognized as different arrays; thus, 
the arrays Z( ) and Z$( ) can be defined simultaneously.

The DIM statement cannot be used within a FOR...NEXT loop.

<I><B>See Also:</B></I> LOCATE, GPRINT

<I><B>PURPOSE:</B></I>
Specifies the starting point of dot graphics display.

<I><B>REMARKS:</B></I>
GCURSOR specifies the display starting point for the dot pattern to be displayed by the 
GPRINT command.

The screen consists of 239 columns of 70 rows of dots, which can be addressed by column 
numbers 0 to 238 and row numbers 0 to 69. Any dot on the screen can therefore be 
addressed as a starting point by specifying the column number with expression 1 and the 
row number with expression 2.

<I><B>EXAMPLE:</B></I>
10 CLS
20 WAIT
30 GCURSOR (115,20)

Note:
The value of expressions 1 and 2 may range from -32768 to 32767. It should be noted, 
however, that if the value of expression 1 is outside the range of 0 to 238 or that of 
expression 2 is outside the range of 0 to 69, the display starting point will become a virtual 
point which is outside the screen boundaries.
